/**
 * Exercise 21 - Numbers to Names
 * Many programs display information to the end user in one form but use a different form inside the program.
 * For example, you may show the word Blue on the screen, but behind the scenes youâ€™ll have a numerical value for that color or an internal
 * value because you may need to represent the textual description in another language for Spanish-speaking visitors.
 *
 * Write a program that converts a number from 1 to 12 to the corresponding month.
 * Prompt for a number and display the corresponding calendar month, with 1 being January and 12 being December.
 * For any value outside that range, display an appropriate error message.
 *
 * Example Output
 *
 * Please enter the number of the month: 3
 * The name of the month is March.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * Use a switch or case statement for this program.
 * Use a single output statement for this program.
 *
 * Challenges
 *
 * Use a map or dictionary to remove the switch statement from the program.
 * Support multiple languages. Prompt for the language at the beginning of the program.
